###Summary
My topic is: what makes the big bang theory one of the most popular shows and I demonstrate my reasons in 5 parts. That is characters, writing/script, costume, set and emotion. Firstly, they have funny characters. They’re smart in work but idiots in life. Secondly, they have a good writing, since they have an experienced writer who has made a lot of famous works, a technical director who is a professor in the university of California and the live audience, which is seldom seen in other sitcoms and really helps a lot improving the writing. Then is the costume, the characters do have their own style. They wear unharmonious costume that makes them funnier. It’s barely happened that the appearance of characters can be so much destroyed. The big bang theory is also standing out for its incredibly detailed set, no matter the comic book store, the labs or the apartments. Details make them real. Last, their emotion of romance and friendship is another taste you can get. You have no idea what will happened to them in the future and you may be surprised by how they fit well for each other. Their friendship moves the audience a lot. Eventually I conclude that audience like the big bang theory because of the visual and emotion impact and their eager to support the weakers.
